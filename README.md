# Codecademy Number Guesser Project

## Project Goals
In this project, youâ€™ll write JavaScript functions to power a small guessing game. Your code will run in the browser instead of just the terminal, but you have an output section to help you test your functions and show you if you have syntax errors.

## Built with
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

## How to play
To play the game, go to <a href="https://rahimguerfi.github.io/number-guesser/" target="_blank"> Play Number Guesser</a>. Pick a number between 0-9. Try and guess a number that will be the closest to the mystery number.  Whoever is closer, you or the computer, will win. Hit the 'next round' button to play another round. The game will keep the ultimate score. Hit refresh to start over.

## Challenges and Credits
This was a practice project from the full stack program at Codeacademy.<br>
I wrote all of the script.js file and made some changes to game.js file.<br>
index.html, style.css and game.js were given to me.
